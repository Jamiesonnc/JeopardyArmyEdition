What does Command Responsibility make a soldier accountable for? 

Command responsibility refers to collective or organizational accountability and includes how well the unit performs 
their missions. For example, a company commander is responsible for all the tasks and missions assigned to the 
company; his superiors hold him accountable for completing them. Commanders give military leaders the 
responsibility for what their sections, units, or organizations door fail to do. NCOs are therefore responsible to fulfill 
not only their individual duties, but also to ensure that their team and unit are successful.The amount of responsibility 
delegated to you depends on your mission, the position you hold and your own willingness to accept responsibility.

What is an implied duty? 

Implied duties often support specified duties, but in some cases they may not be related to the MOS job position. These 
duties may not be written but implied in the instructions. They’re duties that improve the quality of the job and help 
keep the unit functioning at an optimum level. In most cases, these duties depend on individual initiative. They 
improve the work environment and motivate soldiers to perform because they want to, not because they have to. For 
example, while not specifically directed to do so, you hold in-ranks inspections daily to ensure your soldiers’ 
appearance and equipment are up to standards.

Reporting System (ERS)? 

DA Pam 623-3 

What does the Evaluation Reporting System (ERS) identify? 

The ERS identifies officers and non-commissioned officers who are best qualified for promotion and assignments to 
positions of higher responsibility. ERS also identifies Soldiers who should be kept on active duty, those who should be 
retained in grade, and those who should be eliminated. 

(DA PAM 623-3 May 2006 /1-8 / PDF 8) 

Under the ERS a Soldier is evaluated on performance and potential. In this system, what three kinds of 
evaluations are given? 

1. 
Duty evaluations. Either the DA Form 67–9 or DA Form 2166–8 is used for these evaluations. 
2. 
School evaluations. Either the DA Form 1059 and DA Form 1059–1 is used for these evaluations. 
3. 
DA evaluations. Selection boards and personnel management systems are used for these evaluations. Duty and 
school evaluations are single time-and-place evaluations and are used to make DA evaluations. DA evaluations 
cover the entire career of an officer and non-commissioned officer. 
(DA PAM 623-3 May 2006 /1-8 / PDF 8) 

DA evaluations focus on an individual Soldier's potential. They are judgments on their ability to perform at 
current and higher grades, and they are also made to judge whether an officer or NCO should be retained and 
given greater responsibility in their present grade. In making DA evaluations, what three factors are 
considered? 

1. 
Army requirements for leaders: officers and non-commissioned officers frequently change. At times, the Army 
has a need for leaders with certain backgrounds, experience, and expertise. The size of the Army leader corps by 
law in terms of strength by grade. Army needs limit the number of selections and assignments that can be made. 
Thus, a leader’s potential is partially determined by how they compare with their peers. 
2. 
Duty performance. Performance of duty is an extremely important factor in determining a leader’s potential. 
Duty performance is judged by how well a Soldier performs their assigned tasks and how well they meet Army 
professional values uniquely established for each respective corps.

technical units, supporting staff managers, and technical specialists. One consideration in determining 
qualifications is the different skills and backgrounds required by different specialties. Another consideration is a 
Soldier’s individual progress through specialist fields to positions of greater responsibility. In addition, their 
length of service, civil schooling, military schooling, or other unique skills required by the Army are considered.

What is the origin of the Salute? 

The origin of the Hand Salute is uncertain. Some historians believe it began in late Roman times when assassinations 
were common. A citizen who wanted to see a public official had to approach with his right hand raised to show that he 
did not hold a weapon. Knights in armor raised visors with the right hand when meeting a comrade. This practice 
gradually became a way of showing respect and,in early American history, sometimes involved removing the hat. By 
1820, the motion was modified to touching the hat, and since then it has become the Hand Salute used today.

Blue - Identifies hydrography or water features such as lakes, swamps, rivers, and drainage. 
Green - Identifies vegetation with military significance, such as woods, orchards, and vineyards. 
Brown - Identifies all relief features and elevation, such as contours on older edition maps, and cultivated land on 
red-light readable maps. 
Red - Classifies cultural features, such as populated areas, main roads, and boundaries, on older maps. 
Other - Occasionally other colors may be used to show special information. These are indicated in the marginal

Develop a survival pattern that lets you beat the enemies of survival. This survival pattern must include food, water, 
shelter, fire, first aid, and signals placed in order of importance. For example, in a cold environment, you would need 
a fire to get warm; a shelter to protect you from the cold, wind, and rain or snow; traps or snares to get food; a means 
to signal friendly aircraft; and first aid to maintain health. If injured, first aid has top priority no matter what climate

Camouflage, Concealment and Decoys 


What is Camouflage, Concealment and Decoys (CCD)? 

CCD is the use of materials and techniques to hide, blend, disguise, decoy, or disrupt the appearance of military targets 
and/or their backgrounds. CCD helps prevent an enemy from detecting or identifying friendly troops, equipment, 
activities, or installations. Properly designed CCD techniques take advantage of the immediate environment and natural 
and artificial materials. 

(FM 20-3 Aug 1999 / 1 / PDF 6) 

What Army Field Manual covers Camouflage, Concealment, and Decoys? 

FM 20-3 

Is each Soldier responsible for Camouflaging and Concealing themselves and their equipment?

(FM 20-3 Aug 1999 / 1-5 / PDF 7) 

The primary goal of CCD is to avoid enemy detection. What seven rules are critical when considering how to 
avoid detection or identification? 

1. Identify the enemy's detection capabilities. 
2. Avoid detection by the enemy's routine surveillance. 
3. Take countermeasures against the enemy's sensors. 
4. Employ realistic, CCD countermeasures. 
5. Minimize movement. 
6. Use decoys properly. 
7. Avoid predictable operational patterns.

different types of crops and vegetation found on most farms. 
2. Urban. Urban terrain is characterized by uniform rows of housing with interwoven streets and interspersed trees 
and shrubs. 
3. Wooded. Woodlands are characterized by natural, irregular features, unlike the geometric patterns of agricultural 
and urban terrains.

What is decoying? 

Decoying is deploying a false or simulated target(s) within a target's scene or in a position where the enemy might 
conclude that it has found the correct target(s). Decoys generally draw fire away from real targets. Depending on their 
fidelity and deployment, decoys will greatly enhance survivability..

The LCSS is the standard Army camouflage net currently available, What do the stainless steel fibers in the 
LCSS do? 

They reduce a vehicle's visual and radar signatures. Stainless steel fibers in the LCSS material absorb some of the radar 
signal and reflect most of the remaining signal in all directions. The result is a small percentage of signal return to the 
radar for detection. 

(FM 20-3 Aug 1999 / 3-63 / PDF 30)
