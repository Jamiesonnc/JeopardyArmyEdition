What is the origin of the Salute? 

The origin of the Hand Salute is uncertain. Some historians believe it began in late Roman times when assassinations 
were common. A citizen who wanted to see a public official had to approach with his right hand raised to show that he 
did not hold a weapon. Knights in armor raised visors with the right hand when meeting a comrade. This practice 
gradually became a way of showing respect and,in early American history, sometimes involved removing the hat. By 
1820, the motion was modified to touching the hat, and since then it has become the Hand Salute used today.

and departs. When reporting indoors under arms, the procedure is the same except that the headgear is not removed and

Blue - Identifies hydrography or water features such as lakes, swamps, rivers, and drainage. 
Green - Identifies vegetation with military significance, such as woods, orchards, and vineyards. 
Brown - Identifies all relief features and elevation, such as contours on older edition maps, and cultivated land on

Develop a survival pattern that lets you beat the enemies of survival. This survival pattern must include food, water, 
shelter, fire, first aid, and signals placed in order of importance. For example, in a cold environment, you would need 
a fire to get warm; a shelter to protect you from the cold, wind, and rain or snow; traps or snares to get food; a means 
to signal friendly aircraft; and first aid to maintain health. If injured, first aid has top priority no matter what climate

Camouflage, Concealment and Decoys 


What is Camouflage, Concealment and Decoys (CCD)? 

CCD is the use of materials and techniques to hide, blend, disguise, decoy, or disrupt the appearance of military targets 
and/or their backgrounds. CCD helps prevent an enemy from detecting or identifying friendly troops, equipment, 
activities, or installations. Properly designed CCD techniques take advantage of the immediate environment and natural 
and artificial materials. 

(FM 20-3 Aug 1999 / 1 / PDF 6) 

What Army Field Manual covers Camouflage, Concealment, and Decoys? 

FM 20-3 

Is each Soldier responsible for Camouflaging and Concealing themselves and their equipment?

(FM 20-3 Aug 1999 / 1-5 / PDF 7) 

The primary goal of CCD is to avoid enemy detection. What seven rules are critical when considering how to 
avoid detection or identification? 

1. Identify the enemy's detection capabilities. 
2. Avoid detection by the enemy's routine surveillance. 
3. Take countermeasures against the enemy's sensors. 
4. Employ realistic, CCD countermeasures. 
5. Minimize movement. 
6. Use decoys properly. 
7. Avoid predictable operational patterns.

different types of crops and vegetation found on most farms. 
2. Urban. Urban terrain is characterized by uniform rows of housing with interwoven streets and interspersed trees 
and shrubs. 
3. Wooded. Woodlands are characterized by natural, irregular features, unlike the geometric patterns of agricultural 
and urban terrains.

What is decoying? 

Decoying is deploying a false or simulated target(s) within a target's scene or in a position where the enemy might 
conclude that it has found the correct target(s). Decoys generally draw fire away from real targets. Depending on their 
fidelity and deployment, decoys will greatly enhance survivability..

The LCSS is the standard Army camouflage net currently available, What do the stainless steel fibers in the 
LCSS do? 

They reduce a vehicle's visual and radar signatures. Stainless steel fibers in the LCSS material absorb some of the radar 
signal and reflect most of the remaining signal in all directions. The result is a small percentage of signal return to the 
radar for detection. 

(FM 20-3 Aug 1999 / 3-63 / PDF 30)
