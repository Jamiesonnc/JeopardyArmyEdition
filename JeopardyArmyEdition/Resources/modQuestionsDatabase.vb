In the next 5 seconds, pull the bolt to the rear (check for ejection and feeding of belt), release it, re-lay on the target, and attempt to fire. If the bolt-latch release and trigger are depressed at the same time, the bolt goes forward and the weapon should fire automatically. 2. If the gun again fails to fire, wait another 5 seconds, pull the bolt to the rear (engage with the bolt latch if applicable), and return the retract ing slide handle to its forward position. Open the cover and remove the belted ammunition. Inspect the gun to determine the cause of stoppage. A hang fire or cook off can cause injury to personnel or damage to the weapon. To avoid these, the gunner must take the following precautions: 1. Always keep the round locked in the chamber the first 5 seconds after a misfire occurs. This prevents an explosion outside of the gun in event of a hang fire. 2. If the barrel is hot, the round must be extracted within the next 5 seconds to prevent a cook off. When more than 150 rounds have been fired in a 2-minute period, the barrel is hot enough to produce a cook off. 3. If the barrel is hot and the round cannot be extracted within the 10 seconds, it must remain locked in the chamber for at least 5 minutes, to guard against a cook off. 4. Keep the gun cover closed during the waiting periods.
